# Masterboard Refactored with Different Libraries and Patterns

This repository demonstrates how the original Masterboard (`/original` directory) can be refactored using various libraries and design patterns. This approach allows for cleaner, more maintainable, and potentially more scalable code.

## Refactoring Examples

This repository includes two refactored versions of the Tic Tac Toe game, showcasing different approaches:

1. **Vanilla Refactor:** This version stays close to the original implementation's structure but utilizes more modern JavaScript features and best practices. It serves as a foundational example for understanding the core logic before diving into more complex refactorings.  A TypeScript version of this refactor is also available on the `typescript` branch.

2. **React Refactor:** This version leverages React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React promotes a declarative programming style, making the code more concise and easier to reason about compared to the imperative style often used in vanilla JavaScript. This refactor also includes a TypeScript implementation on the `typescript` branch.

I recommend going through the examples in the following order:

1. **Vanilla Refactor:** Grasp the core logic and best practices in this foundational refactor.
2. **React Refactor:** Explore a more declarative approach using React for building the user interface.
